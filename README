/!\ /!\
This plugin is tested on vim 7.2 with patches up to 264,
it may not work with previous versions!
up-to-date compiled vim versions for windows can be found here :

/!\ /!\

To use this plugin, you must :
- Be running on Windows with .net Framework >= 3.0
- use gVim version >= 7.2 (possibly with some patches)
then launch gvim and type the following commands to start the plugin :
:ShowCodeOverview
:CodeOverviewAuto 
:SnapshotFile

By default the automatic overview generation is deactivated to avoid
hurting performances. If you always want CodeOverview, put the first two
commands in your .vimrc. The last command is just to force refresh for
your current file.

Usage :
======
:ShowCodeOverview 
    Start the overview panel.

:HideCodeOverview 
    Hide the overview panel
    Also stop automatic overview generation.

:CodeOverviewNoAuto 
    Disable automatic overview generation.

:CodeOverviewAuto 
    Setup automatic overview generation.

:SnapshotFile 
    Refresh your current overview.

As some requested, Here's the code source of binary parts, it's a little messy, sorry :

Known problems :
==============
- View doesn't really track vim scrolling
It's the current trade-off between performance and functionality.
